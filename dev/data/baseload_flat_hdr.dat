# Power dispatched to the electricity grid from a wind farm with battery energy storage.
# Reference signal, or set point, is fixed to a constant value.
# Per-unit base quantities are 100 MW for power and 100 MWh for energy.
# BATTCAP:	Battery capacity, per unit (p.u.) 
# SOCMIN:	Minimum battery state of charge (SOC), (p.u.)
# SOCMAX:	Maximum battery SOC, (p.u.)
# CHRGRT:	Maximum battery charge rate, (p.u.)
# DCHRGRT:	Maximum battery discharge rate, (p.u.)
# WINDCAP:	Wind farm registered capacity, (p.u.)
# PDREF:	Reference signal, or set point, for power dispatched to the grid, (p.u.)
# DISPINT:	Number of dispatch intervals in computer simulation
# PWCNT:	Number of dispatch intervals in which wind power generated exceeds set point
# PWPROB:	Probability that wind power generated exceeds set point, %
# PDCNT:	Number of dispatch intervals in which power dispatched to the grid exceeds set point
# PDPROB:	Probability that power dispatched to the grid exceeds set point, %
